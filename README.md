# Servo Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a linear regression model to accurately predict servo performance based on input features. The specific goals include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand relationships and identify patterns.
3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Identify key features and create new ones to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Development**: Implement and train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
5. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune model parameters and use cross-validation to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
6. **Model Validation**: Test the model on unseen data to ensure reliability.
7. **Results Interpretation**: Visualize and interpret the modelâ€™s predictions and provide insights into feature impacts.
8. **Deployment**: Discuss practical applications and steps for deploying the model in real-world scenarios.

## Explanation

This project aims to create an accurate and reliable predictive model for servo performance using linear regression. By systematically preparing data, analyzing relationships, and optimizing the model, we ensure it can effectively predict outcomes based on input features. This model has practical applications in automation and robotics, aiding in the efficient and precise control of servo mechanisms.
